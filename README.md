gVim colorscheme with a gray/monochrome look.

### goals
* Decent contrast
* A *good* looking pallete, [which has been standardized](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html).  
**Note:** Not all colors were used from ^
* Somewhat be able to different various elements of code quickly
* Designed for languages I personally use the most
* Go easy on eyes, especially at night.
